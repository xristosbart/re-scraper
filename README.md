# re-scraper

**INTENTION**: This project will implement a pyhton scraper that fetches real estate data and
creates a dataset to be used for ML model training and testing.

**DESCRRIRPTION**: This scraper will be implemented using scrapy and potentially selenium. It will
fetch data from initially rightmove but potentially in the future this could expand. The data will
mostly be size of property, location, price, number of beds, type of property (multiple classifications),
as well as the date of the entry and date of observation. Other markers might become relevant in the future.
